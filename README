
I have a bug that I'm sick of tracking. Would you be better than I am?

The "Main" class that lauches the genetic algorithm. 
Make sure that the logger is not in "trace" before lunching it - or make sure you have a folder D:\temp and 6Go of free memory on your hdd (@see log4j.properties).

Sometime during the simulation, my fitness can drop by 40 or more for the same candidate. It mean that a strategy that was doing 40% of wins against BigMoney is now doing 0%. 

Would you be able to find out the origin of the bug?

hints so far:
- This bug occurs with my GA, but not with the regular simulator (I therefore suspect a race condition somewhere)
- If you do not specify any BuyCondition, the bug is not present
- When the bug arises, the log seems to show evidence that the candidate have been playing a BigMoney strategy on some of its game.

I'm getting sick of that bug :/
